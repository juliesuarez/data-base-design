-- Question 1: Build a Complete Database Management System
-- About the Project
-- It's a marketplace because of its core function of connecting players and clubs
-- For Football Players: Aspiring players can sign up for free, create a detailed profile with their stats (position, country, etc.), 
-- and upload videos of their skills, goals, and match highlights. 
-- This gives them a professional online portfolio to showcase their abilities.
-- For Clubs & Scouts: Clubs and scouts can register and subscribe to the platform to gain access to a growing database of talent. 
-- They can search for players, view their detailed profiles, and watch their performance videos.
